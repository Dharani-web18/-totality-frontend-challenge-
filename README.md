Property Rental Website

#Overview
The Property Rental website is a React-based web application designed to showcase a variety of rental properties. Users can browse through property listings, view detailed information about each property, and book properties directly from the homepage


#Project Structure
The project is organized into components and pages to maintain a modular and scalable structure. Key components include:

Navbar: A navigation bar that allows users to move between different pages of the website.
PropertyCard: A reusable component that displays individual property information, including an image, title, description, price, and a "Book Now" button.
SearchBar: A search component to filter property listings (to be expanded in future versions).
Home Page Design
The homepage serves as the primary entry point for users, displaying a variety of properties with essential details. The design focuses on simplicity and user experience, ensuring that property information is easy to browse.
Property Listings: Each property is displayed as a card with an image, title, description, price, and a "Book Now" button. The cards are arranged in a responsive grid layout.
Sample Data: The properties are currently displayed using sample data. This data can be replaced with dynamic content fetched from an API or database in future updates.


#Tech Stack

React.js: The main framework used for building the user interface. React allows for component-based architecture, making the codebase modular and maintainable.
React Router: Used for handling routing within the application, allowing for navigation between different pages.
CSS: Custom styles are written in CSS to ensure that the application is visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript (ES6+): The primary language used for all development within the React environment.
